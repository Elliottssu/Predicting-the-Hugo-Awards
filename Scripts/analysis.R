# this function takes in an author, the year, and the dataset (defaulting to Hugo) and gives 
# the number of award nominations the author has had since their most recent award win BEFORE the
# current year. Therefore, it counts the current year's nomination (if any) as a nomination, 
# but will not output 0 if the author also won that same year.
